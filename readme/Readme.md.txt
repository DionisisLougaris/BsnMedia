                               BSN MEDIA

Introduction:

BSN MEDIA is an intra-buissness social network that allows
members of a business to communicate,
organize, be informed and express their point of view
in matters concerning the company and their colleagues.
This software can be used on the
business sector enabling members of a
team to have remote communication, organization and
cooperation, thus avoiding personal contact, which in
many cases can be time consuming, or even
impossible. The combination of features offered by BSN
Media make the user work experience much more enjoyable.

The users who will use the program, are members of a
company. Depending on their position in its hierarchy, they are divided into
employee, chief and boss qualities. Each user regardless of his status,
has the ability to exchange messages and make connections with others
users, post posts and edit personal and public information and much more.
For example, chiefs create groups, consisting of employees,
to which they assign projects. These are evaluated by the boss,thus giving an idea of ​​the result and the
collaboration of the Group for the Project assigned to it.Finally, every user must have
simple computer skills as well as social networking programs.

Description:

There were many options for the programming language that could be used
to create and develop the application, including Java,
C and Python. BSN Media, however, focuses on Java, as this
language offers more possibilities in the development of object-oriented programming and graphical interface.
We also used Git, which is the most popular control system
publishing, a website for developers hosting and sharing
their code.

The first, and perhaps most important class we will create is User, which
is the default entry point for any web application. The rest classes are more 
or less assosiated with User ,the Company or a Group.
